This is a mini-project from codecademy. The purpose of this project is to practice the use of loops.

Brief description:
    Take a phrase like ‘turpentine and turtles’ and translate it into its “whale talk” equivalent: ‘UUEEIEEAUUEE’.

    There are a few simple rules for translating text to whale language:

    There are no consonants. Only vowels excluding “y”.
    The u‘s and e‘s are extra long, so we must double them in our program.

To check results run .html file
